## Idea ##
Disaster Monitor is an application for iOS that allows users to monitor earthquakes globally and receive notifications for specific seismic events. The proposed idea was: 

*Be always aware of whatâ€™s happening around you: be sure to avoid earthquakes!</br>
With this app, you will always be notified when there is some seismic activity going on.</br>
Set custom rules to be notified whenever an event is happening.</br>
See them in beautiful maps and share your status on the social to let your parents know that you are safe!</br>*

The development of the entire project was assisted by a tutor from [Bending Spoons](https://www.bendingspoons.com).
